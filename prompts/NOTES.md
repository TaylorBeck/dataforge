Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs architect this like a real startup-grade web app, but optimized for your solo/founder-scale, efficient, cost-conscious build. You‚Äôre looking to:

Impress with technical architecture

Keep costs low

Deliver real performance

Allow future scalability

Showcase good engineering judgment

üß† Core Product: What Are We Building?
A web-based platform to generate, post-process, evaluate, and export structured synthetic text datasets using LLMs, with a clean UI/UX for AI practitioners.

This includes:

Prompt templates

LLM API interaction

Metadata tagging + eval

Filtering pipelines

Dataset management

Export/download

üß± Key Architectural Components
Layer	Components
Frontend	UI for prompt design, job creation, pipeline viewing, dataset management
Backend API	Job orchestration, queue management, LLM API wrapper, dataset versioning
Worker system	Background processing for long LLM jobs
Database	Datasets, prompt templates, generation logs
Storage	Output data (JSONL, CSV), user uploads
Queue	Async job handling and retries
Optional: Auth, billing, team sharing, usage tracking	

‚úÖ Recommended Tech Stack: Production-Ready but Lean
‚öôÔ∏è Backend
Component	Recommended	Why
Web framework	FastAPI	Async, Python-native, easy to scale, OpenAPI docs for free
Worker/Job queue	Celery + Redis (or RQ)	Reliable, widely used with Python, great for async LLM calls
LLM wrapper	Direct API SDKs (OpenAI, Anthropic), OR litellm	litellm lets you switch between providers easily
Storage	AWS S3 or Supabase Storage	Durable and scalable
Database	PostgreSQL	Best for structured data, querying datasets, logs, metadata
ORM	SQLModel / SQLAlchemy / Prisma	Typed, clean, performant
Eval Metrics	Built-in via scripts (toxicity, repetition, entropy, etc.)	Custom logic over batches

üåê Frontend
Component	Recommended	Why
Framework	Next.js (App Router)	Mature, fast, good SSR, scalable ‚Äî ideal for dashboards
UI Library	shadcn/ui (Radix-based)	Clean DX, customizable, dev-friendly
State management	React Query / Zustand	Minimal and effective for async data
Charts/UI extras	react-table, recharts, framer-motion	For showing dataset stats, filters, cost analysis
Tailwind CSS	Yes	Perfect for beautiful and consistent UI without overhead

üîß DevOps / Infra
Component	Recommended	Why
Hosting	Railway, Render, Fly.io, Supabase	Low-cost, scalable PaaS with Postgres
CI/CD	GitHub Actions	Automate tests and deploys
Analytics / Logs	Sentry, PostHog (optional)	Errors + user flow if needed
Monitoring	Railway / UptimeRobot (simple)	Monitor job queue or health routes

üí∞ Cost-Conscious Alternatives
Service	Premium Option	Cheaper Alternative
Frontend hosting	Vercel	Cloudflare Pages (if pure frontend)
Backend/API	AWS/Lambda	Fly.io or Railway
DB	AWS RDS	Supabase / Neon
Worker queue	Celery w/Redis	RQ or Dramatiq
Auth	Clerk/Auth0	Supabase Auth or DIY JWT
LLM usage	OpenAI	Mistral (via ollama), Together.ai, or Groq (if blazing fast needed)

‚ö° Performance Considerations
Use Celery queue for LLM jobs ‚Äî avoid blocking HTTP threads.

Use batch processing to reduce token costs and API latency.

Use retry strategies + exponential backoff for flaky LLM APIs.

Cache common prompt outputs in Redis if relevant.

Lazy-load frontend views when possible (Next.js dynamic imports).

Pre-sign download URLs for big datasets from S3 to keep traffic off your backend.

üöÄ Scalability Path
You're starting solo, but want room to grow.

Stage	Tech Choice	Reason
MVP	FastAPI + Celery + Redis + PG	Everything deploys on one box or Fly.io easily
Small team	Deploy workers on a second instance	Isolate heavy job processing
Growing usage	Swap out Redis for AWS SQS / RabbitMQ	Horizontal scalability
Enterprise	Auth, team features, RBAC, audit logs	Add gradually with backend-first thinking

üß† Summary of Good Engineering Practices to Showcase
Async jobs for long-running tasks (LLM calls, filtering)

Version-controlled datasets + schema validation

Clean UI with live feedback on token cost

Error resilience (retry logic, job status states)

Testable + modular codebase

Real-time UX (loading states, progress bar, previewing generations)

Separation of concerns: prompt templates, data jobs, exports

‚úÖ TL;DR: Stack Recommendation
Layer	Tech
Frontend	Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
Backend API	FastAPI
Workers	Celery + Redis
Storage	S3 or Supabase Storage
Database	PostgreSQL
Hosting	Railway or Fly.io
LLM API	OpenAI, Claude, Mistral, via litellm abstraction layer

This stack is modern, performant, cost-efficient, and portfolio-ready ‚Äî especially if you design the UI with the polish of something like Notion or Runway.
